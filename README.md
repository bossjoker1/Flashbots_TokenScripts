# Flashbots_TokenScripts
use Flashbots to transfer specific token


This project implements front-running based on Flashbots, successfully achieving the secure transfer of a token from an account with a leaked private key in a real-world scenario. If you successfully simulate locally and generate a transaction hash, but the transaction is finally not on-chain, please check Etherscan and select an RPC node with a high block production frequency.

Disclaimer: This script is intended for educational sharing only, cannot guarantee successful front-running every time, and must not be used for illegal activities.
